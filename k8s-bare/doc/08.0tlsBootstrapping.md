# kublet TLS bootstrap
  For configuring TLS bootstrapping, please refer to [TLS bootstrapping](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/),
  and [Authenticating with Bootstrap Tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/).

To configure for TLS bootstrapping and optional automatic approval, you must configure options on the following components:

1. kube-apiserve
2. kube-controller-manager
3. kubelet
4. in-cluster resources: ClusterRoleBinding and potentially ClusterRole

## kube-apiserver configuration
* Recognizing CA that signs the client certificate by adding --client-ca-file=FILENAME flat to the kube-apiserver command to enable client certificate authentication.
* Authenticating the bootstrapping kubelet to the **system:bootstrappers** group. Bootstrap tokens are described in detail [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/).  kube-apiserver recognizes it as a special token, and grants anyone authenticating with that token special bootstrap rights, notably treating them as a member of the **system:bootstrappers** group. This fulfills a basic requirement for TLS bootstrapping
* Authorize the bootstrapping kubelet to create a certificate signing request (**CSR**). just need to create a **ClusterRoleBinding** that binds the **system:bootstrappers** group to the cluster role **system:node-bootstrapper**


## kube-controller-manager configuration
In order for the controller-manager to sign certificates, it needs the following:

* access to the “Kubernetes CA key and certificate” that you created and distributed. Adding **--cluster-signing-cert-file and --cluster-signing-key-file** to kube-controller-manager command.
* enabling CSR signing: Bind **system:bootstrappers** to **ClusterRole nodeclient** to o enable the kubelet to request and receive a new certificate; Bind **system:nodes** group to **ClusterRole selfnodeclient** to enable the kubelet to renew its own client certificate.


## kubelet configuration
*  path to store the key and certificate it generates (optional, can use default)
* A path to a kubeconfig file that does not yet exist; it will place the bootstrapped config file here
* A path to a bootstrap kubeconfig file to provide the URL for the server and bootstrap credentials, e.g. a bootstrap token
* Optional: instructions to rotate certificates
* Related commands
 ```bash
   1 kubectl get secrets  -n kube-system | grep bootstrap-token

   2 kubectl delete secret bootstrap-token-c48688 -n kube-system

   3 kubectl get secret bootstrap-token-4a2add  -n kube-system -o yaml

   4 echo 'YmZmZWVm' | base64 --decode

   5 kubectl get clusterrolebinding
   6 kubectl delete clusterrolebinding k8s-bootstrapping/k8s-approval/k8s-renewal
   7 kubectl create clusterrolebinding k8s-bootstrapping --clusterrole system:node-bootstrapper --group system:bootstrappers
 ```
