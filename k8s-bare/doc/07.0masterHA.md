# Master API Server High Availability

Use haproxy for load balancing, keepalived for VIP to provide HA for Kubernetes API servers.

Check keepalived master:
```bash
  ip addr list ens160

  output:
  2: ens160: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:b7:79:d9 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.220.209.202/24 brd 10.220.209.255 scope global ens160
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet 10.220.209.200/24 scope global secondary ens160
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

  systemctl status haproxy
  systemctl status keepalived

  journalctl -fu haproxy
  journalctl -fu keepalived
```

## Note
  1. sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
  2. net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1--allows processes to bind() to non-local IP addresses, which can be quite useful
